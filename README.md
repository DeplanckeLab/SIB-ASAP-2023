# Using ASAP for Single-Cell Analysis - 2023 Course (Online)

SIB/EPFL course by [Vincent Gardeux ](https://people.epfl.ch/vincent.gardeux)

2023 Nov. 08th & 2023 Nov. 15th - Online

<br/>

In recent years, single-cell transcriptomics has become a widely used technology to study heterogeneous and dynamic biological systems. A large number of new tools and approaches have been developed for analyzing this new type of data.

The goal of this course is to provide theoretical and practical knowledge in the basic analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets.

This course covers the standard analysis of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset using the Seurat pipeline.
It follows to some extent the ["standard tutorial from Seurat"](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html), which we encourage the readers to consult when they want to dive more into single-cell data analyis.

In this course, we will use an example data set consisting of 7,000 cells from the ["Fly Cell Atlas"](https://flycellatlas.org/) repository. These cells all come from the **Body** part, which was dissociated as a whole and sequenced using 10x Genomics technology over 10 batches, mixing males and females.

This set of 7,000 cells was carefully selected/filtered from the original **Body dataset** that consists of 96,926 cells. They belong to *a certain number* of differently annotated cell types.

**2023.11.08 (3h)**: After a short introduction to single-cell genomics, and more particularly single-cell transcriptomics, we will see what is ASAP and how we can use it to perform single-cell analysis on an example dataset.
**2023.11.15 (3h)**: Hands-on session on a single-cell dataset where participants will perform all steps of the single-cell analysis pipeline themselves, and annotate cell types.

At the end of the course, the participants are expected to:
- run a single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline using ASAP
- choose the best tools and parameters for each analysis step
- carry out cell-type annotation and downstream analyses
- disseminate their experience to the members of their group


**Pre-requisites - background knowledge**
- This course is designed for beginners. Basic knowledge of single-cell analysis (equivalent to the SIB courses Single-cell Transcriptomics or NGS - Single-cell RNA-Seq Analysis) is required.

**Pre-requisites - material & software**
- This webinar will be streamed, the participants are thus required to have their own computer with an Internet connection. ASAP is a fully online tool, so no other installation is needed.
